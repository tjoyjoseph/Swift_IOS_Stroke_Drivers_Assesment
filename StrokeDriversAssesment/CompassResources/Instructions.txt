“This time the black arm of the compass indicates a direction of travel” Demonstrate the directions by pointing to each card and indicating the direction it shows. 
“Can you now, as you did before, position these cards on the grid, so that each of the vehicles on these cards (point to the pile of Directions cards) goes in the direction indicated on the compass cards? (point to the Compass cards).  The roundabout sign (point to the roundabout sign) is always at the bottom. There are more cards than available spaces, so some of the cards will not fit in. I will do the first one as an example.”
